# Caesar Cipher Cryptanalysis

See [Caesar Cipher on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) for more information about the
Caesar Cipher.

This is a simple C program that illustrates how to break the cipher using letter
frequency analysis. It was developed just to play around a little bit and not to
forget my elementary knowledge of C.

# Usage

To build (requires standard make and gcc tools):

    make

To run:

    ./breakcaesar

# Further Information

Original creation date unknown; definitely before January 2015.
